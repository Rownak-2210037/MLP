    "# Support Vector Machines (SVM) \n",
    "Quick GuideSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.Its primary goal is to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data into different classes with the maximum possible margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminology\n",
    "#### Hyperplane: \n",
    "In 2D, it's a line. In 3D, it's a plane. In $n$-dimensions, it’s a decision boundary that separates classes.\n",
    "#### Support Vectors: \n",
    "The data points closest to the hyperplane.These are the \"critical\" points; if we move them, the boundary moves.\n",
    "#### Margin: \n",
    "The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vector.SVM aims to maximize this margin.\n",
    "#### Hard Margin: \n",
    "Works only when data is perfectly separable. No misclassifications allowed.\n",
    "#### Soft Margin: Allows some misclassifications (using a slack variable) to handle noisy data or outliers. Controlled by the parameter\n",
    "#### The Kernel Trick\n",
    "The Kernel TrickWhen data is not linearly separable (e.g., a circle inside a square), we use Kernels to project data into a higher dimension where a linear separation is possible.\n",
    "Linear Kernel: For linearly separable data.\n",
    "Polynomial Kernel: For curved boundaries.\n",
    "RBF (Radial Basis Function): The most popular; handles complex, overlapping boundaries.\n",
    "Mathematical IntuitionDecision Boundary: $w \\cdot x + b = 0$Hinge Loss: Penalizes points that are on the wrong side of the margin:$$\\text{Loss} = \\max(0, 1 - y_i(w \\cdot x_i + b))$$"
