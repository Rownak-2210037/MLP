### About Project
This project focuses on understanding and implementing core neural network models, starting from MLP and ANN to modern architectures like Transformers and LLMs.
Both mathematical foundations (forward and backpropagation) and practical implementations are explored.
The repository includes theory, MATLAB/Python code, and small experiments for each model.

### Topics Covered
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Forward Propagation
- Backpropagation (Mathematical Derivation)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Transformer Architecture
- Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- MATLAB (for numerical understanding)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the mathematical foundations of MLP and ANN
- Derive and implement forward and backpropagation
- Compare classical ML models with neural networks
- Build intuition for advanced architectures like Transformers and LLMs
